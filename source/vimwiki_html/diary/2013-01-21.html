<h3 id="toc_0.0.1">Summary</h3>

<p>
I saw someone said on the WeiBo, "XiangYu is the biggest failure". Then someone says "It depends". And I also watched a video about Jack Ma. He said he always learn something from failures.
</p>

<p>
From this point of view, I think I should also learn from XiangYu. At the same time, I should also think about a question. 
</p>

<p>
"Why should I start my Master degree? What do I get from the master degree?"
