<h3 id="toc_0.0.1">Summary</h3>

<p>
Coming back from Xia Meng, I known I should do something to prepare for my future job.
</p>

<p>
Recently, I practice Vim all the day. I find it's super powerful. After two days struggle with clang_complete plugin,
finally I get my wanted results. It's really happy a process.
</p>

<p>
Now I plan to learn Vim much more, and begin to read the book, named &lt;&lt;Byte of Vim&gt;&gt;. I should finish it within two days.
</p>

<p>
Last, but not least. I must be quick with my Master degree papers now! My time is limited, I should hurry up.
</p>

<p>
Great articles are rewritten, not be written. So I must begin to write something now.
</p>

<p>
This is my first diary. In the following diaries, I'll write them in the following steps:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Summary yesterday's work.

<li>
Check yesterday's todo tasks.

<li>
Make today's todo tasks.

</ol>
