Hello,everybody!

I’m zilongshanren,you could call me ZiLong or ShanRen if you like. Why on earth did I choose such a strange name?Because I’m a big fan of The Three Kingdoms,especially I appreciate ZiLong Zhao & ShanRen ZhuGe,so I combine their names for my own unique one. 

大家好，我是子龙山人。
为什么会起这个名字呢？因为，我是一个不折不扣的三国迷，喜欢赵子龙的英勇和诸葛山人的神机妙算，故取名为子龙山人。

In 2011,I started my own personal blog in cnblogs.com,one of the biggest programmer’s community in China.During that time, I kept studying IOS game development with cocos2d and enjoy it. I have translated a bunch of cocos2d game tutorials.Here is the link.(BTW:Now I’m a core member of Tyran tutorials team, which is also the only one team in Ray Wenderlich’s tutorials translation team.)

我以前在博客园开了一个[  博客  ](http://www.cnblogs.com/zilongshanren/),翻译和撰写了大量cocos2d游戏开发教程。

Now, I’m a master degree student in Central South University , this is my third year in school. My major is CS and I am fond of making games. I’m also active in cocos2d community and more eager to share my learning experience with you.

Comments or suggestions will be welcome! 

目前，我就读于中南大学计算机系,研三在读.2013年毕业，热爱游戏开发,目前活跃在cocos2d游戏开发社区,欢迎大家一起交流.
