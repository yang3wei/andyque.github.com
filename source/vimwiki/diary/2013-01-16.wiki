=== Summary ===

Coming back from Xia Meng, I known I should do something to prepare for my future job.

Recently, I practice Vim all the day. I find it's super powerful. After two days struggle with clang_complete plugin,
finally I get my wanted results. It's really happy a process.

Now I plan to learn Vim much more, and begin to read the book, named <<Byte of Vim>>. I should finish it within two days.

Last, but not least. I must be quick with my Master degree papers now! My time is limited, I should hurry up.

Great articles are rewritten, not be written. So I must begin to write something now.

This is my first diary. In the following diaries, I'll write them in the following steps:

# Summary yesterday's work.
# Check yesterday's todo tasks.
# Make today's todo tasks.

=== Today's Dodo Tasks ===

* [ ] Finish the book <<Byte of Vim>>
* [ ] Setup a wiki system for myself
* [ ] learning English writing skills
