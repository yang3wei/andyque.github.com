=== Summary ===

This is a great world with lots of seduce. The truth is that my plan run a thousand mile away.

In the daytime, it goes well. But after supper, all goes wrong. I watch a whole night TV shows. That's really a waste of time.

TV show is really good, it gives me lots of fun and I learn a lot from it. But the plan should abolish.

One sentence is great:"Changes always go faster than plans".
