=== Summary ===

Yestody, my main job is making vim as wiki page editor and a diary editor. Now the result is perfect. I really like the Vim way to edit my wiki page and diaries.

But as a IT person, I should focus more on my own health. So I should early sleep and early get up and do one hour excises a day. That's important!

Now my main task is to finish my Master degree paper. I should plan it.

First I should read one paper a day and programming OpenCV at least on hour a day. That's important.
